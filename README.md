# AquaPi
Aquarium control with Raspberry Pi

AquaPi is a control unit for an aquarium, based on a [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) single board computer.
  
It provides classical aquarium features as like timer switches for light or displaying water temperature and further customizable functions.
  
The GUI is provided as a website, allowing to operate it remotely (e.g. via a smart phone) as well as locally via a (touch) display connected to the Rasperry Pi.
