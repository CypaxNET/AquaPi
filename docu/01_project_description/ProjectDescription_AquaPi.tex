  \section{Introduction}
  \ThisProjectName~is a control unit for an aquarium, based on a \hyperref{https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi}{}{}{Raspberry Pi} single board computer.
  
  It provides classical aquarium features as like timer switches for light or displaying water temperature and further customizable functions.
  
  The GUI is provided as a website, allowing to operate it remotely (e.g. via a smart phone) as well as via a connected (touch) display.
  
  \section{Intended use}
  \subsection{Functionality}
  The intended use of \ThisProjectName~is to 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item control typical aquarium  devices (light, pumps, heater, water and gas valves)
    \item display and supervise water temperature
    \item provide a user interface (remotely or locally accessed via a website)
    \item provide "service functions" -- temporarily activate/deactivate aquarium devices for special occurrences like aquarium maintenance or fish feeding.
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{System lifetime}
  The system lifetime is based on the durability of typical aquariums and expected to be up to 10 years.
  
  \subsection{Device quantity}
  It is expected that \ThisProjectName~will be installed in 10\textsuperscript{0} to 10\textsuperscript{1} aquariums.
