%As <who> <when> <where>, I <want>, so that <why>


As a caretaker, when using the GUI, I want to see an overview on the most important aquarium parameters, so that I can realize situations that require intervention quickly.
Important aquarium parameters are water temperature, operating mode and operating state of outputs.

As a caretaker, I want to be informed by E-Mail if aquarium parameters are out of a safe bound, so that I can intervene in time.

As a caretaker, I want to be able to adjust thresholds for the safe bound of parameters individually, so that I can adapt them to the specific aquarium.
